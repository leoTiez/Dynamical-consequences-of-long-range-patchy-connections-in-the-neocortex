# The investigation of the dynamical consequences of long-range patchy connections in the visual cortex V1

This repository collects the code for simulation and experiments that was used for
my thesis project. The code is written in Python3.6 and uses mainly the Nest framework.

## Requirements
PyNest is maintained in a separate ppa repository. Use the provided script to install the
latest stable version of PyNest. Run

```bash
sudo sh nest_install.sh
```

The required Python modules that can be downloaded via pip are compiled in the
`requirements.txt` file and can be installed via

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
